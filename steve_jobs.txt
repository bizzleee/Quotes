“Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life.”

“Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice.”

 “Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.”

“My favorite things in life don’t cost any money. It’s really clear that the most precious resource we all have is time.”
